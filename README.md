 [Getting Over It Custom Maps Website](https://raj-srikar.github.io/GOI-Website/)
 
 A website where you can find and play custom maps for getting over it.
 
 To add new maps, or to delete a map, or update a map's info, clone this repository onto your machine and use the [ManagerGUI.exe](https://github.com/Raj-Srikar/GOI-Website/blob/main/ManagerGUI.exe) to modify the [maps.json](https://github.com/Raj-Srikar/GOI-Website/blob/main/maps.json) JSON file according to your need or you can even edit the [maps.json](https://github.com/Raj-Srikar/GOI-Website/blob/main/maps.json) JSON file directly. After it's done, commit the changes to the repository and submit a pull request.
### Note
While opening the Executable file, the windows defender displays a warning. You can skip the warning by doing this:

This happens because the windows fails to recognize the publisher of the application as there won't usually be any publisher for the executable as it's generated by the Python.
